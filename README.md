# openCW
open Cube World Alpha (pre 2019 release) rewrite

This project aims to be a fork of Cube World Alpha. It will reach feature parity with the last Alpha release, and only after then will it be branched into adding new features that are not in the alpha.

Compatibility with tools, bugs, and glitches that work with the alpha, such as item duplication, world editors, etc, will be implemented to a T, except where they're completely implementation-defined (reliant on Wollay's specific RNG or runtime memory layouts).

See https://github.com/veloren/veloren for a project that's like Cube World Alpha, and that you can already play. It's not aiming to be an identical implementation, though.

openCW will be like [TrueCraft](https://github.com/ddevault/TrueCraft) for Cube World Alpha.
